ssh-rdp

ssh-rdp.sh is a shell script that aims to allow you to stream the desktop and the sound from a remote host
with minimum latency and control it.
Every input device can be forwarded thanks to netevent.
That means you can even forward your joypads and play remotely.
There is no need to install any couterpart "server" on the remote host.
Of course it needs to have some specific packages installed.

Requirements:
* Local and Remote: bash,ffmpeg,openssh,netevent
* Local:  inotifywait, wmctrl, optional: mpv + taskset from util-linux to get even lower latency but with more cpu use.
* Remote: xdpyinfo,pulseaudio

To make it work, start it the first time without arguments to see usage informations.
Next, start it with the "inputconfig" parameter and pay attention to what it asks you.

There are other tunables you can find in the script.

Drawbacks:
* Due to some pulseaudio shortcomings, sometimes the audio get desyncronized, it will recover by itself by speeding up, and you can hear high-pitched sound.
* Just clicking in the remote window does not pass the control to it, because that is the ffplay window; so hitting the hotkey is mandatory.
* For remote gaming, turning on cpu encoder may give better results than gpu encoder, if the gpu is already at its limit.

I'm open to suggestions to make this software better!
Notably, it lacks a way to use amd and intel gpu encoders.
If anybody could write and post a VIDEO_ENC string, it would be really nice.
